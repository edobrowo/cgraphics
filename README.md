## C Graphics Library
This project is intended as a practical exploration of 2D graphics, with the end goal of building a library for creating 2D generative art.
# Completed
* Color: truecolor type, implemented as a uint32 and helper macros
* Bitmaps: general-purpose representation of a raster image that is an array of uint32's
* PNG encoder: a bare-bones PNG encoder that takes as input a bitmap, and produces a truecolor, uncompressed, unfiltered PNG file
# Next up
* Primitives: lines, triangles, circles, etc.
* Curves: beziers, splines
* Noise: Perlin, simplex, fractal brownian
